## Overview
This repository contains three inter-related applications namely Authenti-Kator-2.0, fabric-firebase-logger, and productAuth, aimed at providing authentication and logging services for products. 

## Authenti-Kator-2.0
Authenti-Kator-2.0 is an Android application that allows users to scan QR codes and authenticate the products. The application offers login and signup functionality which are implemented using Firebase DB for storing user credentials.

## fabric-firebase-logger
fabric-firebase-logger is an application that listens for changes in the Firebase DB, particularly the change in product status (isAuthenticated). The DB structure is as follows:

\```json
"product_1": {
    "isAuthenticated": false,
    "product_type": "sneakers",
    "serial_number": 116708,
    "authenticated_by": null,
    "authenticated_at": null
}
\```

Whenever there is a change detected in the DB, it triggers the `createProduct` method in the chain code.

## productAuth
productAuth is a logging system designed to log the changes of DB in the Hyperledger Fabric. It utilizes chain code to track and log these changes into the Hyperledger Explorer.

## Getting Started
Details on how to use these applications will be provided soon.
